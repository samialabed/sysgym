# SysGym
A suite of real-world systems and interface to compare iterative optimization algorithms.





## Supported environments



- [x] gem5-Aladdin: [System Documentation](https://github.com/harvard-acc/gem5-aladdin), SysGYM documentation

- [ ] PostgresSQL

- [ ] RocksDB

- [ ] Apache Flink



Feel free to contribute your own environment, please check `CONTRIBUTION` as well as (TODO: Provide link to documenting how to add new environment)



## Quick start

### Run a single optimization loop of a given environment 

```Python

TODO: API demo showing a single iterative loop 

```

### Run several benchmark against a specific environment 
```Python
TODO: show the environment runner script
```


## Supported libraries

You can use this interface and these following extensions to run optimizations using these following methods:

* Turbo: Extension (TODO: link to our library that provide NNI link)
* [BoTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/botorch/): Extension (TODO: link to our library that provide NNI link)
* DeepGP: Extension (TODO: link to our library that provide NNI link)
* [NNI suite](https://github.com/microsoft/nni): Extension (TODO: link to our library that provide NNI link)


## Setup 

Each environment has its own setup requirement, you can either install environment using script `install_all.sh` or a specific environment as found in the scripts directory.
